### Prompt: Analyse the following problem and suggest approach, key features, algorithms, evaluation metrics, testing etc to include to achieve most accurate prediction for the target ML model:


Nice problem — predictable in name, not in outcome. Below I’ll give a compact, practical playbook you can follow end-to-end to get the lowest MAE on the MLB wins prediction task. I’ll cover data prep, feature engineering (high-leverage items), modelling choices, validation strategies (very important here because of era shifts), evaluation & tests, and post-model checks. No fluff — straight to the wins.

### 1 — Quick summary objective

Predict season wins (W, integer) from seasonal team stats (1901–2016). Evaluation: MAE. Model must generalize across eras — treat time/era leakage carefully.

⸻

### 2 — High-impact feature engineering (do these first)
```
Base features are raw counts; convert to rates, per-game, and domain formulas:
	1.	IP = IPouts / 3 (innings pitched)
	2.	RPG = R / G, RAPG = RA / G (runs scored/allowed per game)
	3.	Run differential = R − RA and RD_per_game = (R − RA)/G — single most predictive feature historically.
	4.	Pythagorean win expectation
Win\%{pyth} = \frac{R^x}{R^x + RA^x} → initial x ≈ 1.83; tune x on training data (learnable via grid search).
→ **PredictedWins_py = Win%{pyth} × G**
	5.	Rate pitching stats per 9 innings: K9 = SOA / IP * 9, BB9 = BBA / IP * 9, HR9 = HRA / IP * 9, ERA (already there) but recompute to sanity-check.
	6.	Batting rate stats: BA = H / AB; OBP ≈ (H + BB) / (AB + BB) (approximate — acceptable given available fields).
	7.	K/BB (pitcher control), SO_per_game, BB_per_game, HR_per_game, SB_per_game.
	8.	Fielding impact: Errors_per_game = E / G; DP_per_game, FP (use FP as given).
	9.	Era / decade flags: keep era/decade indicators for analysis but be cautious using them in training if test set is different era — better to use mlb_rpg or continuous year features than categorical era flags. If you do include them, also include interaction with Run differential (era × RD).
	10.	Missingness indicators: older seasons may miss stats; create binary flags for fields that had missing values. Missing pattern itself is predictive.
	11.	Transformations & interactions: RD^2 or sqrt(RD) if nonlinearity; interaction Pythagorean × ERA; R/RA ratio.
	12.	If team identifier / history exists in dataset: add lag features — previous season W, rolling mean W over 2–3 years, roster continuity proxies. (Only if data available — don’t leak future info.)
	13.	Aggregate season context: mlb_rpg (already provided) is gold for era normalization — compute adjusted Run Differential: RD_adj = RD × (mlb_rpg / team_rpg) or similar.
```

### Definitions:
```
1. Innings Pitched (IP)
	•	Baseball games track outs. Every inning has 3 outs.
	•	The dataset gives you IPouts (total outs pitchers got).
	•	Divide by 3 to get innings pitched. Example: 270 outs → 90 innings pitched.

⸻

2. Runs Per Game (RPG, RAPG)
	•	RPG = Runs scored ÷ Games played → how many runs your team scores on average each game.
	•	RAPG = Runs allowed ÷ Games played → how many runs your team gives up per game.

⸻

3. Run Differential (RD)
	•	RD = Runs scored − Runs allowed.
	•	Big positive RD → strong team; big negative RD → weak team.
	•	You can also divide by games to get RD per game, which makes it comparable across seasons.

⸻

4. Pythagorean Win Expectation
	•	A famous baseball formula that predicts win percentage based only on runs scored and allowed.
	•	Roughly: if you score way more runs than you give up, you’ll win most of your games.
	•	The formula is:
Win% = (Runs Scored ^ 1.83) ÷ (Runs Scored ^ 1.83 + Runs Allowed ^ 1.83)
	•	Multiply that win percentage by the number of games to get predicted wins.

⸻

5. Pitching Rates (per 9 innings)
Pitching stats are usually normalized to “per 9 innings” (a full game for a team). Examples:
	•	K/9: strikeouts per 9 innings.
	•	BB/9: walks allowed per 9 innings.
	•	HR/9: home runs allowed per 9 innings.
	•	ERA (Earned Run Average): runs charged to the pitcher per 9 innings.

⸻

6. Batting Rates
	•	Batting Average (BA) = Hits ÷ At-bats.
	•	On-base percentage (OBP) = How often a player/team reaches base. Approximate formula: (Hits + Walks) ÷ (At-bats + Walks).

⸻

7. Control & Per-game Stats
	•	K/BB = strikeouts ÷ walks (shows pitcher control).
	•	SO per game = strikeouts ÷ games.
	•	BB per game = walks ÷ games.
	•	HR per game = home runs ÷ games.
	•	SB per game = stolen bases ÷ games.

⸻

8. Fielding Impact
	•	Errors per game = Errors ÷ Games.
	•	Double plays per game = Double plays ÷ Games.
	•	Fielding percentage (FP) = Provided directly; measures defensive reliability.

⸻

9. Era/Decade Flags
	•	Indicators for historical eras (dead-ball, steroid era, etc.) or decades.
	•	Useful for analysis, but risky to use directly for training (test set may not have them).

⸻

10. Missingness Indicators
	•	Some old seasons don’t have full stats recorded.
	•	You can add “missing value flags” (1 if stat missing, 0 if not). Sometimes the fact a stat is missing is itself informative.

⸻

11. Transformations & Interactions
	•	Apply math tweaks to features when relationships aren’t straight lines.
	•	Example: square the run differential (RD²) or take its square root.
	•	Combine features, like Pythagorean expectation × ERA.
	•	Ratios like Runs Scored ÷ Runs Allowed.

⸻

12. Team History Features (if team IDs exist)
	•	Add “lag” features like last year’s wins, average of last 2–3 years, etc.
	•	Helps capture continuity of team strength. (But be careful not to use future data.)

⸻

13. Adjusted Run Differential
	•	Since different eras had different scoring environments, adjust RD relative to the league average runs per game that year.
	•	Example: if your team’s run differential is +100 in a low-scoring era, that’s more impressive than +100 in a high-scoring era.
```
⸻

### 3 — Preprocessing / cleaning
```
	•	Sanity checks and fixes (e.g., IPouts divisible by 3).
	•	Outlier handling: wins beyond reasonable bounds clip to [40,120] only for input errors. For model outputs, clip predictions to [40,120].
	•	Missing values:
	•	If small fraction → median impute by era/decade.
	•	If many missing in old seasons → impute with era median + missingness flag or train era-specific models.
	•	Multicollinearity: many batting/pitching counts are collinear (AB, H, R, HR). Use correlation matrix + VIF. If collinearity hurts linear models, use regularization (Ridge) or tree models (less sensitive).
	•	Scaling: tree models don’t need it; linear/NN do — use StandardScaler.
```
⸻

### 4 — Modelling roadmap (start simple, then escalate)
```
Baselines
	•	Mean predictor (mean W).
	•	Pythagorean predicted wins (as a single feature model).

Class of models to try (in order)
	1.	Linear models: OLS, Ridge, Lasso — fast baseline, interpretable.
	2.	Tree ensembles: Random Forest (quick), then Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost) — they will be your workhorse.
	•	Use MAE (L1) objective where supported (or Huber).
	•	Tune learning_rate, max_depth, min_child_weight, n_estimators, subsample, colsample_bytree.
	3.	Ensembles: blend/stack linear + GBM + RF for small improvement.
	4.	GAMs (Generalized Additive Models) — good compromise for nonlinearity while staying interpretable.
	5.	Neural nets (tabular MLP) — try if lots of engineered features; not first choice.
	6.	Quantile regression / probabilistic models: LightGBM quantile or gradient boosting to output quantiles (e.g., 10/50/90) — gives uncertainty and often slightly better median MAE when using median prediction.

Loss / objective
	•	Train with MAE (L1) or Huber; XGBoost/LightGBM can be configured to minimize MAE directly.
	•	If using RMSE objective but evaluating MAE, tune accordingly — better to match objective to MAE.
```
⸻

### 5 — Validation strategy (critical)
```
Because dataset spans 1901–2016 and eras shift, normal random CV can overestimate performance.

Recommended CVs
	1.	Time-aware CV (rolling origin): train on years ≤ Y, validate on year Y+1. Slide forward. This mimics prediction into a future season and tests generalization.
	2.	Leave-one-era / leave-decade-out CV: train on all but one era/decade → validate on held-out era. Tests robustness across structural shifts.
	3.	Grouped K-fold by year: group rows by year so teams from same year are either all in train or all in val (prevents leakage due to season-wide effects).
	4.	Use nested CV for hyperparam tuning inside time splits.

Metrics to log on validation
	•	MAE (primary)
	•	RMSE (sensitive to large errors)
	•	Median absolute error
	•	MAE by decade/era / win_bin (check whether model performs poorly on extreme teams)
	•	Distribution of residuals (plot residual vs predicted)

⸻

6 — Feature selection & interpretability
	•	Global feature importance from tree ensembles.
	•	SHAP values for local and global interpretability (useful for error analysis and showing why model predicts a given W).
	•	Partial dependence plots for top predictors (RD, Pythagorean, ERA, SO9, etc.).
	•	VIF for linear models to remove or combine collinear predictors.

⸻

7 — Hyperparameter tuning
	•	Use Bayesian optimization (Optuna) or random search over sensible ranges. For XGBoost/LightGBM:
	•	learning_rate: 0.01–0.2
	•	n_estimators: 100–5000 (use early stopping)
	•	max_depth: 3–10
	•	min_child_weight / min_data_in_leaf: 1–50
	•	subsample: 0.6–1.0
	•	colsample_bytree: 0.4–1.0
	•	reg_alpha/reg_lambda: tune for regularization
	•	Optimize MAE (or quantile loss) directly.

⸻

8 — Rounding / submission specifics
	•	Models predict continuous W. Round to nearest integer for submission.
	•	Clip to plausible range: e.g., W = int(round(pred)), W = min(max(W, 40), 120).
	•	Consider post-hoc calibration: if your model tends to bias high or low by a constant, correct with calibration offset learned on validation set.
	•	Optional: use quantile predictions to choose a rounding scheme that minimizes MAE on validation (e.g., round up for ties if median bias negative).

⸻

9 — Error analysis & tests to run
	1.	Residual plots: residual vs predicted, residual vs RD, residual vs era.
	2.	MAE by era/decade/win_bin: ensures model isn’t failing on historical periods or extreme teams.
	3.	Case studies: examine top 10 worst predictions — are there data issues (missing lineup, truncated stats), or roster changes not captured?
	4.	Ablation tests: remove Pythagorean, remove RD, remove pitching rates — measure MAE delta. This tells you which engineered features are indispensable.
	5.	Stability test: perturb key features by ±5–10% and check prediction sensitivity.
	6.	Out-of-distribution test: train on older eras and validate on recent (2010–2016) to check modern generalization.
	7.	Ensemble diversity test: measure correlation between model errors before ensembling.

⸻

10 — Advanced ideas (extra points)
	•	Learn Pythagorean exponent x as a feature (fit x per era or treat x as learnable by a small model).
	•	Multi-target / multi-task: predict win_bins and W jointly; classification loss can regularize regression.
	•	Stacked model: first-level models (Pythagorean, linear, GBM) → second-level meta-learner (Ridge).
	•	Model teams separately by era cluster: cluster historical distributions and train specialized models for each cluster.
	•	Use external data if allowed: payroll, injuries, preseason projections, strength of schedule, park factors — big improvements if available (but watch leakage of future info).
	•	Probabilistic forecast: predict distribution (quantiles) instead of point estimate — gives confidence bounds.

⸻

11 — Pipeline checklist (practical steps)
	1.	EDA: distributions, missingness map, correlation heatmap, wins vs RD scatter.
	2.	Feature engineering: compute all rates, Pythagorean, interaction terms, missingness flags.
	3.	Set up time-aware CV and evaluation logging (per era).
	4.	Train simple baselines (mean, Pythagorean).
	5.	Train Ridge + XGBoost/LightGBM with MAE objective.
	6.	Hyperparam tuning (Optuna) with early stopping and time CV.
	7.	Ensemble top models; calibrate offsets on a holdout year.
	8.	Final model: predict test set, round & clip, produce submission.csv.
	9.	Postmortem: SHAP, residual analysis, document weaknesses.

⸻

12 — Evaluation summary (what to report)
	•	Primary: MAE on validation and holdout years.
	•	Secondary: RMSE, MedianAE, R².
	•	Breakdown: MAE by era, by win_bin, by team (if team ID exists), and calibration (mean residual).
	•	Visuals: predicted vs actual scatter, residual histograms, SHAP summary.

⸻

13 — Quick tips & pitfalls
	•	Run differential and Pythagorean expectation are your heavy hitters — don’t skip them.
	•	Beware leakage: do not use future aggregated fields or target-derived bins in training.
	•	Era shifts: validate across time/era — random CV will lie to you.
	•	Direct MAE objective is better than optimizing RMSE when the competition metric is MAE.
	•	Small sample problems in older eras: use imputation + missingness indicators or era-specific models.
